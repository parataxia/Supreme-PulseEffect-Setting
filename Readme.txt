Required: Linux of course, along with Pulseaudio + PulseEffects. Basic knowledge of Linux required (install and make work pulseaudio + pulseeffects in given distribution of Linux.)

A good EQ setting that is very balanced and probably sounds perfect with thresholds that neither tither or tear! (please re-locate archive's json file to ~/.config/PulseEffects/output/Perfect EQ (+6 lane mixing).json !)

Alao contains many IR files (impulse settings for Convolver plugin in PulseEffects that must be set manually after loading this EQ.) Choose what pleasures your ears and lobe of apperceptive minds! and I recommend anything `Razor Sound` and 48kHZ for Convulsion reverb!

Works great if you happen to be using Foobar2000 and included equalizer setting as well to top off the sound with a nice punch and sparkle. (make sure to hit `Auto Level` in EQ setting with Foobar2000!)


p.s Unsure how to make it work with `pipewire` but if you use latest linux audio stack, PulseEffects EQ and IRS should work similarly.
